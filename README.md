> # This project is deprecated.
> **2021-02-20:**
> With the release of Jamf Pro 10.27.0 and visual updates to the Self Service app, branding options have significantly changed. The "header" no longer serves as a background behind the branding icon and text, so this project is not needed.

# self-service-branding-template
Templates for creating your Jamf Self Service branding image.

## Included templates

- `Self-Service-header-template.afdesign` for Affinity Designer
- `Self-Service-header-template-AdobeEPS.eps` for Illustrator EPS format
- `Self-Service-header-template.ai` for Adobe Illustrator (CS6 format)
- `Self-Service-header-template.psd` for Adobe Photoshop (CS6 format)

## Using the templates

These templates give you a reasonable approximation of what your header image will look
like used in Jamf Pro Self Service.

Here's what it looks like:

The areas matted by the "USUALLY HIDDEN" bars are, like it says, usually not displayed 
when Self Service launches. If a user resizes the window, these areas may come into 
view.

When dropping this template document directly into Self Service, you can see it's not
pixel-perfect, but gives you a good guideline when designing your header.

The area not matted by the "USUALLY HIDDEN" bars can be considered the "focus area" of
your header. When Self Service launches with its default size, the image content within
this focus area should be visible.

Consider this sweet image of Ryu blasting a hadoken at Ken. We drop it in the template
and make sure the bottom of the hadoken blast and the top of Ken's head are visible
within the focus area.

When Self Service launches, we should see this reflected in the header area.

If we resize Self Service to scrunch it up a bit, notice some of the content from the
"usually hidden" area of the template image comes into view.
