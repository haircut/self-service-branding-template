# self-service-branding-template
Templates for creating your Jamf Self Service branding image.

## Included templates

- `Self-Service-header-template.afdesign` for Affinity Designer
- `Self-Service-header-template-AdobeEPS.eps` for Illustrator EPS format
- `Self-Service-header-template.ai` for Adobe Illustrator (CS6 format)
- `Self-Service-header-template.psd` for Adobe Photoshop (CS6 format)

## Using the templates

These templates give you a reasonable approximation of what your header image will look
like used in Jamf Pro Self Service.

Here's what it looks like:

The areas matted by the "USUALLY HIDDEN" bars are, like it says, usually not displayed 
when Self Service launches. If a user resizes the window, these areas may come into 
view.

When dropping this template document directly into Self Service, you can see it's not
pixel-perfect, but gives you a good guideline when designing your header.
